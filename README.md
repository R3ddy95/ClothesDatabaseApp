# Clothes Database App ðŸ‘šâ€‹â€Š
Clothes Database App is designed to manage a second-hand clothing database. <br>
It allows users to perform various operations related to the available clothing items, users, and sales. <br> 
It provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the database. When you run the program, it displays a menu with different options.

## How it works
The application starts by presenting a menu to the user.

For example, if the user selects option 1, the program displays a list of available clothing items.

If the user selects option 2, the program guides them through the process of purchasing an item and updates the data accordingly.
